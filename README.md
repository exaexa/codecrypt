# Codecrypt

The post-quantum cryptography tool.

Codecrypt is currently unmaintained, although I still successfully use it. If
you are interested in developing/maintaining it, ping me.

#### About

This is a GnuPG-like unix program for encryption and signing that uses only
quantum-computer-resistant algorithms:

 - McEliece cryptosystem (compact QC-MDPC variant) for encryption
 - Hash-based Merkle tree algorithm (FMTSeq variant) for digital signatures

Codecrypt is free software. The code is licensed under terms of LGPL3 in a good
hope that it will make combinations with other tools easier.

##### Used cryptography overview

To achieve the stated goal, codecrypt uses a lot of (traditional, but
"quantum-secure") cryptographic primitives. Choices of primitives were based on
easy auditability of design, simplicity and provided security.

The git repo of codecrypt contains `doc/papers` with an unsorted heap of
academic papers and slides about relevant topics.

Stream ciphers used:

- ChaCha20, the recommended choice from djb
- XSynd stream cipher as an interesting and nontraditional candidate also based
  on assumptions from coding theory; used NUMS (it requires lot of NUMS) are
  explained in `doc/nums` directory in the repo.
- Arcfour for initial simplicity of implementation. After recent statistical
  attacks I cannot recommend using any RC4 variant anymore, but provided
  padding and the "offline-only" usage of codecrypt keeps the usage mostly
  secure.

CRHFs used:

- Cubehash variants were selected for implementation ease, really clean design,
  quite good speed and flexibility of parameter choices. This is also the only
  hash possibility when Crypto++ library is not linked to codecrypt.  KeyIDs
  are CUBE256 hashes of corresponding serialized public keys.
- ripemd128 for small hashes
- tiger192 is used as an alternative for Cubehash for 192bit hashes
- There's always a variant with SHA-256, SHA-384 or SHA-512.

Signature algorithms:

- FMTSeq with many possibilities and combinations of aforementioned CRHFs
- SPHINCS256 support is scheduled for next release

Encryption algorithms:

- MDPC McEliece on quasi-cyclic matrices. The implementation uses some tricks
  to speedup the (pretty slow) cyclic matrix multiplication (most notably
  libfftm3 in this version). For padding using the Fujisaki-Okamoto scheme, the
  cipher requires a stream cipher and a CRHF, used ciphers and CRHFs are
  specified in the algorithm name -- e.g. MCEQCMDPC128FO-CUBE256-CHACHA20 means
  that the parameters are tuned to provide 128bit security, uses CUBE256 hash,
  and ChaCha20 stream cipher.
- Quasi-dyadic McEliece was included in codecrypt as an original algorithm, but
  is now broken and prints a warning message on any usage.

Caveats:

Cryptography is **not intended for "online" use**, because some algorithms
(especially the MDPC decoding) are (slightly) vulnerable to timing attacks.

## Quick How-To

Everything is meant to work mostly like GnuPG, but with some good simplicity
margin. Let's play with random data!


	ccr -g help
	ccr -g sig --name "John Doe"    # your signature key
	ccr -g enc --name "John Doe"    # your encryption key

	ccr -K  #watch the generated keys
	ccr -k

	ccr -p -a -o my_pubkeys.asc -F Doe  # export your pubkeys for friends

	#(now you should exchange the pubkeys with friends)

	#see what people sent us, possibly check the fingerprints
	ccr -inaf < friends_pubkeys.asc

	#import Frank's key and rename it
	ccr -ia -R friends_pubkeys.asc --name "Friendly Frank"

	#send a nice message to Frank (you can also specify him by @12345 keyid)
	ccr -se -r Frank < Document.doc > Message_to_frank.ccr

	#receive a reply
	ccr -dv -o Decrypted_verified_reply.doc <Reply_from_frank.ccr

	#rename other's keys
	ccr -m Frank -N "Unfriendly Frank"

	#and delete pukeys of everyone who's Unfriendly
	ccr -x Unfri

	#create hashfile from a large file
	ccr -sS hashfile.ccr < big_data.iso

	#verify the hashfile
	ccr -vS hashfile.ccr < the_same_big_data.iso

	#create (ascii-armored) symmetric key and encrypt a large file
	ccr -g sha256,chacha20 -aS symkey.asc
	ccr -eaS symkey.asc -R big_data.iso -o big_data_encrypted.iso

	#decrypt a large file
	ccr -daS symkey.asc <big_data_encrypted.iso >big_data.iso

	#password-protect all your private keys
	ccr -L

	#protect a symmetric key using another symmetric key
	ccr -L -S symkey1 -w symkey2

	#password-protect symkey2 with a custom cipher
	ccr -L -S symkey2 -w @xsynd,cube512
