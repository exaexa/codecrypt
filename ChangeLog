1.7.4

- maintenance release that fixes some cosmetic issues for debianization

1.7.3

- tiny fixes in mce_qcmdpc to improve decoding

1.7.2

- better autoconfiguration of crypto++ include path
- support redirection to `-'
- add -E option
- update docs a bit
- correctly escape outputs

1.7.1

- rewrite QC-MDPC decoding for speed (still around O(wi^2))
- fix the padding broken on non-byte-aligned numbers

1.7

- add QC-MDPC McEliece variant
- mark QD McEliece as broken
- reimplement bit vectors (for speed)
- some code quality updates
- prevent mangling of command line output by crafted keyring

1.6.1

- simplify padding for symmetric encryption
- fix possible known-plaintext attack against symmetric encryption padding

1.6

- fix fmtseq short message padding bug (fixed by previous)
- virtualize the stream ciphers
- add ChaCha20
- add XSYND
- remove RC4 from standard PRNG
- fix possible side-channel attack on F-O decryption timing
- remove RC4 usage from FMTSEQ, replace with ChaCha20, rename algos
- add support for symmetric encryption (long files!)
- add several new encryption ciphers (use xsynd and chacha)
- add convenience aliases for --gen-key

1.5

- add hashfile support with -S
- gf2m log/antilog saving, and several other speedups
- switched to icase matching for key names

1.4.1

- compile on windows
- cleanup some code, clarify&be helpful on the `-a' option
- prevent possible memory corruption on FMTSeq mangled privkeys
- prevent keyring corruption by interrupted write
- make keyring backups and don't do unnecessary writes

1.4

- add Cubehash, spawn all algorithms using only Cubehash
- make crypto++ dependency optional
- cubehash256 is now used for KeyIDs instead of SHA256
- bump message and keyring version strings

1.3.1

- get rid of bundled hash sources and licensing problems

1.3

- fix too aggressive locking of keyring that caused deadlocks on piping
- fix many warnings and code inconsistencies
- correct licensing information from ccr --version
- prevent possible problems with forged sencode
- add this helpful changelog :)

1.2

- improve arcfour usage (much stuff is thus incompatible with older versions)
- added a manual page
- added H20 variants of FMTSeq (they provide more than 1M signatures)

1.1

- several speed improvements (colex ranking and MceQD decoding)
- cleanup of some unneeded parts

1.0

- key naming fixes
- add 2^192-secure algorithm variants
- improve message padding for encryption (incompatible with previous format)

0.9

- first released version
